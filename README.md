# gleam-rpn

An imperfect Reverse Polish Notation calculator

## Why

This project was created purely as an exercise to learn and practice a new programming language. The implementation will evolve and improve as my skills develop over time.

## Installation

This project doesn't require any third party modules.

``` sh
git clone https://github.com/araujoviana/gleam-rpn
```

## Usage

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests (there aren't any for now)
```

## TODO

* [ ] Calculate inputs of all sizes correctly
* [ ] Add *tests*
* [ ] Enhance modularity to simplify the addition of new operations
* [ ] Include more comments
